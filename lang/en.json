In every session, even when I come without a clear idea of what to work on, Paco listens and asks thought-provoking questions, and we quickly land on a topic that needs to be explored. As we delve into different memories and situations, he helped me shift my perspective and, overall, see things in a way I hadn’t before. I left sessions with Paco with more clarity of heart and mind. He’s given me good and simple advice that has greatly helped reduce my anxiety. Now I can express and understand myself better and navigate relationships more calmly. The session is a good time.
